Israel science foundation (ISF) Grants provide some of the main funding sources for the field of science.
This organization's website contains a wealth of information about the grants over the years,
including details about the number of projects, the funds given, the fields, and the different uses.
Analyzing the above information using quantitative methods, visual representations,
and various text analyses is the goal of this project.
The analyzes we conducted allowed us to obtain information about the distribution of the funds,
the distribution of the various uses, the institutions, the central researchers, and the nature of the winning grants.
